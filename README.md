### development setup:  
`npm install`  
`npm run client-install`  

must use `npm run dev` to run app locally  

### future
* improved authentication: right now the only way to reset a password is by the user contacting me to manually delete their record from my MongoDB Atlas cluster, allowing them to create a new account (very not ideal). 
* expanded time card app
